# ðŸ’“ Heart Disease Prediction App

A simple machine learning web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical input data.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predict heart disease for a **single user** through a form.
- Predict heart disease for **multiple records** via CSV upload.
- Compare predictions from **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** models.
- Visualize model performance with **Plotly charts**.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data handling)
- Plotly (Visualization)
